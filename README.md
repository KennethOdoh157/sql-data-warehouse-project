# 📊 Data Warehousing & Analytics Project

This project is a modern data warehousing and analytics solution focused on ingesting, transforming, and delivering business-ready insights using a structured medallion architecture. It integrates multiple data sources, improves data quality, and supports analytical querying through well-defined layers and processes.

---

## ✅ Project Overview

The project is organized into **three key epics**:

---

### 1. 📌 Requirements Analysis

This phase focuses on understanding business needs and aligning the data strategy accordingly.

- **Data Sources**: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems.  
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data inconsistencies before analysis.  
- **Data Integration**: Merge multiple sources into a unified, analytics-ready model.  
- **Scope**: Focus on the **latest datasets** to reduce latency and complexity.  
- **Documentation**: Provide clear, accessible documentation for both business users and analysts.

### 2. 🧱 Data Architecture Design

A **Data Warehouse** was chosen as the core architecture, implemented using the **Medallion Architecture**, which structures data into three refined layers:

#### 🥉 Bronze Layer – Raw Ingestion
- **Load Type**: Full Load  
- **Purpose**: Store raw, unprocessed data directly from sources for traceability, auditing, and debugging.  
- **Notes**: No transformations applied. Includes metadata such as timestamps and source identifiers.

#### 🥈 Silver Layer – Cleansed & Enriched
- **Load Type**: Full Load  
- **Purpose**: Store cleaned, standardized data that’s ready for integration.  
- **Processes**:
  - Null/duplicate handling  
  - Standardization of fields  
  - Derived fields and data enrichment

#### 🥇 Gold Layer – Business-Ready Data
- **Load Type**: Aggregated and Integrated  
- **Purpose**: Serve reporting tools with business-contextualized data.  
- **Processes**:
  - Apply business logic and rules  
  - Aggregate key metrics  
  - Build star schema models (facts and dimensions)

---

### 3. 🛠️ Project Initialization

- **Task Management**: Tasks created and tracked using **Notion**  
- **Naming Conventions**: Standardized conventions for tables, fields, and scripts  
- **Version Control**: GitHub used for source tracking and collaboration

---

## 📈 Target Outcomes

- A scalable, traceable data warehouse system  
- Unified and analytics-ready datasets  
- Optimized reporting pipeline to drive business insights  
- BI integration through tools like Power BI or Tableau
